# 🎨 ART Projects

Welcome to **ART_Projects** — a collection of interactive Jupyter Notebooks that explore creative applications of **AI, art, and data visualization**.

This repository is designed as a hands‑on workspace for experimenting with artistic generation, evaluation, and custom artistic workflows using code. Whether you’re interested in generative creativity, AI‑driven art analysis, or building novel interactive experiences, this repo is here to help you explore that.
